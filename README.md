# 2d-flight-simulator-python

A simple interactive 2D flight simulator built in Python using `matplotlib`. The simulation models a point-mass airplane with lift, drag, thrust, gravity, and stall effects. Users can control the angle of attack and throttle in real time using keyboard keys. This project was created to learn and demonstrate aerospace physics, vector mechanics, and real-time visualization.


Controls:
| Key         | Action                   |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Up Arrow    | Increase angle of attack |
| Down Arrow  | Decrease angle of attack |
| Right Arrow | Increase thrust          |
| Left Arrow  | Decrease thrust          |
